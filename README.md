# OS Project
My goal is to build a semi-legitimate operating system to showcase and improve my knowledge of computer systems. This repository wil detail my notes and progress on this journey. As a starting point, I used guides made by the youtube channel [*nanobyte*](http://youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev), so note that parts of my documents and code may be taken from them.
